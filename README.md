# CTEC2905_ObjectOrientedDesign Project

Two university projects that were initially stored locally. I have decided to store these projects remotely as I would like to improve my version control skills and knowledge. Whilst strengthening my portfolio.

These projects required me to create custom classes to solve a solution whilst meeting the specification provided. All methods and constructors are documented using Javadoc, allowing an easy understanding of the class's functionality for both myself and external users.

These projects used the JUnit framework to test each individual constructor and method were fit for purpose and functioned correctly, as per their intended use.
